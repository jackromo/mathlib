This is a simple parser designed to parse simple mathematical calculations, 1 line long, of arbitary length.

The parser can:
-Add, multiply, divide, subtract and perform modulus
-Recognize parentheses
-Perform exponents (4e2 and 4^2)
-Perform sin, cos and tan (measured in radians)
-Remember last given answer in special variable 'ans'
-Store variables and predefined functions in a symbol table
